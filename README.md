# Alfreds BMI-Challenge

## Craft Academy Week 2

This is my solution to the BMI Challenge

### Information

This is a BMI-Calculator program. You can choose between Swedish and English,  
and calculate using the **Metric** or **Imperial** system.  
1. To calculate with metric, put your height in **centimeters** and your weight in **kilograms**  
2. To calculate with imperial, put your height in **inches** and your weight in **pounds**  

### Build

This program was created using TDD, with the help of Jasmine.  
With the help of bootstrap and jQuery I was able to improve the feel of the program.
